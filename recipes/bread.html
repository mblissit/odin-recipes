        <p>Many a young chef have tried their hand at this Gielinor staple. One must only take a step onto Tutorial Island to smell the hundreds of burnt loaves keenly crafted by our young protagonists. But fear not! I will teach you how to not only avoid burning your bread, but to make a <em>beautiful</em> golden loaf.</p>
        <p>Lets begin our cooking adventure!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Pot_of_flour" target="_blank">Pot of flour</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bucket_of_water" target="_blank">Bucket of water</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by combining your two ingredients to form a nice <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bread_dough" target="_blank">bread dough</a>. It should simply look like <em>some uncooked dough</em>.</li>
            <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bread_dough" target="_blank"><img src="../img/bread-dough.png" alt="Some uncooked dough" width="200"></a>
            <li>Immediately place the <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bread_dough" target="_blank">bread dough</a> in a <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Range" target="_blank">range</a> to cook. It is of the utmost importance that you do not neglect to remove your bread from the range properly and timely. If I might give any advice on how to achieve a good result I would suggest a few fondles of the range, that will do just great.</li>
